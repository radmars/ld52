Radmars's entry into Ludum Dare 52's Jam.

Phaser w/ TypeScript template used: https://github.com/geocine/phaser3-rollup-typescript

# Commands

-   To start a server on port 3000, run `yarn dev`. Note that you seem to have to rerun the command after making code changes.
-   To syntax check the typescript, run `yarn syntax`
-   To lint the project, run `yarn eslint .`

To skip the intros and disable music, append '?dev=true' to the game's URL.
